//! Wire-side payment artifacts shared by client and node.
//!
//! This module holds the types and helpers that both the client (when
//! building a payment proof for a PUT request) and the node (when
//! verifying that proof before storing a chunk) must agree on.
//!
//! The analogue in `evmlib` is the co-location of `pay` and `verify`
//! on `PaymentVault` — keeping both halves in one crate means the
//! encoding, validation, and on-chain interaction are tested end to end.
