//! Pointers — paid mutable references with an immutable owner.
//!
//! A pointer is a mutable, owner-signed reference stored at an address derived
//! from its owner's public key. Unlike a
//! [`DataChunk`](crate::data_types::DataChunk) its address is **not** its
//! content hash: the address is fixed for the pointer's life while the bytes
//! under it change with every update.
//!
//! Ownership is fixed at creation. There is no transfer, no lineage, no
//! certificates and no key rotation: a former owner keeps its key forever, so
//! transferable ownership cannot be made fork-proof by a local rule. An earlier
//! draft of this module implemented transfer through a genesis object and a
//! chain of transfer certificates; it was reviewed and withdrawn. See
//! `ADR-0015` in `ant-node`.
//!
//! That choice is what lets the design be this small: the owner key is inlined
//! in the record, so validating a pointer needs nothing but the pointer — no
//! fetch, no cache, no second close group, nothing that can be missing.
//!
//! # Encoding
//!
//! Encoded by hand: canonical, fixed-width, big-endian, no length prefixes and
//! no `serde`. The signed payload must not depend on a serializer whose output
//! can change — 1.0's pointer called `rmp_serde` inside its signing routine and
//! silently signed nothing when it failed.
//!
//! ```text
//! format_version  1     byte
//! owner        1952     bytes   ML-DSA-65 public key
//! counter         8     bytes   big-endian u64
//! target         33     bytes   1-byte kind tag + 32-byte address, opaque here
//! signature    3309     bytes   ML-DSA-65 over the preceding 1994 bytes
//!             -----
//!              5303     bytes
//! ```
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! ```text
//! A        = BLAKE3("autonomi.pointer.address.v1" || owner)
//! state_id = BLAKE3("autonomi.pointer.state.v1"   || body)
//! ```
//!
//! `A` routes and decides which nodes are responsible. `state_id` names the
//! authenticated state: it is what sync hints carry, what a fetch decision
//! compares, and **what a quote is paid against**. They are separate because
//! `A` must be stable for the pointer's life while the paid identifier must
//! change with every update, or updates after the first would be free — the
//! defect this design exists to fix.
//!
//! # What this module does not do
//!
//! Payment verification, storage and replication. Those are the node's job.
